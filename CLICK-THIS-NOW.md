## Why I Can't Do This For You

I don't have permission to push to your GitHub main branch or merge pull requests. Only YOU can do this.

But I've:
- ✅ Fixed all the code
- ✅ Removed build issues  
- ✅ Added documentation
- ✅ Prepared everything
- ✅ Pushed to feature branch

The ONLY thing left is **clicking that link and merging**.

## Alternative Solution (If You Can't Merge)

Change Vercel to deploy from the feature branch:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select: balancecipher-v2
3. Settings → Git
4. Production Branch: Change to `copilot/restore-app-tsx-from-commit`
5. Click: Redeploy

## Yes, I CAN Help You!

I've prepared EVERYTHING. The code is fixed and ready. It just needs to be merged to main so Vercel can deploy it.

**This is the LAST step. Please click that link now!**
